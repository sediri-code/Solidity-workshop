Exercice 11: Understanding how contracts communicate with each other.
This contract (11) reads a value from another contract (11b).
In this exercice, you need to:
- Find out the address of contract 11b
- Understand which function of contract 11b contract 11 calls
- Use contract 11b to find out what is the value required
- Call contract 11 with the correct value, which will call contract 11b to check you have the correct value, and deliver your points.
